# YAFOSAN  
**Yet Another Fully Open Source A5 Notebook**

YAFOSAN is a minimalist, fully 3D-printable **refillable A5 notebook** with no pretensions.  
The notebook is designed to be compatible with a **standard two-hole punch** and uses rings to secure the paper.

### Step-by-step guide

1. Carefully attach the rings to **one** of the covers. This cover will be the **back** of the notebook. The rings have an orientation: the stopper should face the **top** of the notebook. Set this assembly aside for now.
2. Attach the punch alignment spacer to the **two-hole punch**, on the side where the paper is aligned before punching. Double-sided tape is recommended so the spacer can be removed later.
3. Take a sheet of paper and fold it in half. 
4. Mark the exact position where the crease forms after folding.
5. Using the punching guide ruler and its two notches, make the alignment marks for the two-hole punch.
6. Punch the paper.
7. Carefully bend the rings open and insert the punched paper.
8. Insert the second cover (this will be the **front** cover). The paper should now be securely held in place.
